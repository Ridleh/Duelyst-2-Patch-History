# Duelyst II Patch History Viewer

This is a Blazor WebAssembly app that lets you explore the complete card history of Duelyst II, including the final patch of the original Duelyst. It’s designed to make it easy to browse every card from every patch, filter by key attributes, and see how the game evolved over time.
What It Does

The goal of this project is to preserve and surface the full design history of Duelyst II. You can view the entire card pool for any patch, compare changes across versions, and filter by:

    Faction

    Card type (units, spells, artifacts, etc.)

    Rarity

    Mana cost

There’s also a legacy mode that shows the final state of Duelyst I, for those interested in how the original game wrapped up.
# Why This Exists

Duelyst had a unique blend of tactics and card game mechanics, and its balance patches often made significant shifts to the meta. This tool was built to make that history more accessible — whether you're a long-time player, a designer studying live game updates, or just someone curious about how a game like this changes over time.

It’s also a good excuse to try out Blazor Web Assembly

Final Notes

This started as a side project to archive Duelyst II's design decisions, but it turned into a useful reference for anyone curious about how competitive digital games shift over time. If you're into game design, web development with Blazor, or just want to revisit an old favorite, this should be worth a look.
